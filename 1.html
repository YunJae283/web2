A desert is a barren area of landscape where little
precipitation occurs and, consequently, living conditions
are hostile for plant and animal life. The lack of
vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the
ground to the processes of denudation. About one-third
of the land surface of the world is arid or semi-arid.
This includes much of the polar regions, where
little precipitation occurs, and which are sometimes called
polar deserts or "cold deserts". Deserts
can be classified by the amount of precipitation
that falls, by the temperature that prevails, by
the causes of desertification or by their geographical
location.
