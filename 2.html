To excrete nitrogenous waste products, mammals
 (and most amphibians) excrete urea diluted in
  water.[15][16] Such xerocoles have adapted to
   make their urine as concentrated as possible
    (i.e. use the least amount of water) to dissolve
    urea. Desert mammals have longer and more deeply
     inset nephrons,[17] as well as smaller and
      fewer cortical and juxtamedullary glomeruli
       (glomeruli being capillary networks where both
       fluid and waste are extracted from blood).
        This in turn leads to a smaller glomerular
         filtration rate, and on the whole, less
          water is transferred from the blood to
          the kidney.[5][17][18] The kidneys of desert
           mammals are also better adapted at reabsorbing
           water from the tubular fluid: though there are
            fewer glomeruli, the xerocole has larger
             juxtamedullary glomeruli than cortical glomeruli
              (the former playing an important role in
               concentrating urine),[19] whereas the opposite
                is true for non-xerocoles. Desert mammals
                 also have longer loops of Henle, structures
                  whose efficiency in concentrating urine is
                   directly proportional to their length.[5][17][20]
                    The efficiency of their loops of Henle is
                    augmented by the increased antidiuretic
                    hormone in their blood.[5]
