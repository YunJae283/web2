Cactuses are xerophytes, which means they
 are adapted to the desert conditions.
  These plants vary in size and generally
   do not have any branches or leaves.
    Cactuses generally have spines that
     range from small hairlike projections
      to large spikes. Xerophytes, like
       cactuses, grow successfully indoors and
        outdoors in other climates when their
        needs are met.
