Desert biomes are the driest of all the biomes.
 In fact, the most important characteristic of
  a desert is that it receives very little
   rainfall. Most deserts receive less than
    300 mm a year compared to rainforests,
     which receive over 2,000 mm. That
      means that the desert only gets 10
      percent of the rain that a rainforest
       gets! The temperature in the desert
        can change drastically from day to
        night because the air is so dry
         that heat escapes rapidly at night.
          The daytime temperature averages 38°C
           while in some deserts it can get down to
 -4°C at night. The temperature also varies
  greatly depending on the location of the desert.
